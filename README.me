👋 Namaste! I'm Abhinab Chhetri
I'm a third-year Computer Science student from Nepal, passionate about system programming and low-level coding. I love diving into the intricacies of Linux and crafting efficient, close-to-the-metal programs. Inspired by legends like Terry A. Davis (creator of TempleOS) and LocalThunk (solo dev of Balatro), I believe in the power of simple, purposeful code.

"Code is art when it runs lean and close to the machine."Sometimes, I wonder if AI makes coding less personal, but I still love the grind.
