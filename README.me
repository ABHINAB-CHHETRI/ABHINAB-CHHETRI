# Hello! I am a Programmer from Nepal ðŸ‘‹

## About Me  
I am a third-year Computer Science student who likes system programming and low-level coding. I find Linux very interesting and enjoy writing small programs close to the machine. I am inspired by Terry A. Davis and Local Thunk (Balatro) because they show how powerful simple and low-level code can be.

I sometimes wish AI did not exist because then coding would feel more personal and rewarding.

## What I Like  
- Writing small and fun system programs  
- Learning how Linux works  
- Making simple and efficient code
